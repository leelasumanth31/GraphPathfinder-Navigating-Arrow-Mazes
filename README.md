# GraphPathfinder: Navigating Arrow Mazes
The objective of this project is to model the Arrow Maze problem as a graph and utilize a known graph traversal algorithm to find a route from the top-left arrow to the bullseye located at the bottom-right corner. The problem entails navigating through a field of arrows (red or blue) where each arrow indicates a direction of movement. The traversal must follow the direction of the arrows, switching between red and blue arrows, until reaching the bullseye. Handling loops and revisiting nodes within a path are essential aspects of solving this problem.
