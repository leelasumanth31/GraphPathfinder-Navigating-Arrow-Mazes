# GraphPathfinder-Navigating-Arrow-Mazes
This code solves the Arrow Maze problem using graph traversal. It represents the maze as a custom graph with arrows as edges and cells as nodes. The algorithm navigates the maze, following arrow directions and switching colors between steps, to find a path from the top-left arrow to the bottom-right bullseye.
